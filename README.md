!! My Project Name: Bunny Adoption Website !!

I have made a website for bunny adoptions, where people can easily find and adopt bunnies. Each bunny has a profile with a picture and details about their personalities, as well as its care requirements and adoption details. My goal is to connect people with these bunnies and give the bunnies a loving and caring home, and through a friendly and easy-to-use interface, users and visitors are able to easily look for what bunny they want which will make the adoption process simple and smooth.

My website contains 5 parts:
1. About Us
2. Recommended Bunnies
3. Adoption Process
4. Contact Us
5. Bunnies' Personal Profile


!! Design Process !!

The design process for my bunny adoption website is centered around creating a seamless and enjoyable experience for individuals seeking to bring a new bunny friend into their lives. My primary audience consists of compassionate individuals or families looking to adopt bunnies and provide them with loving homes. The key goal is to make the adoption process easy, informative, and heartwarming.

The website is tailored to meet the needs of potential adopters by offering a user-friendly interface that allows them to easily browse through profiles of available bunnies. It is understood that these individuals are looking for a connection, so showcasing each bunny's unique personality through engaging content, such as charming photos and detailed descriptions are emphasized.

The project's success is measured by how effectively these meaningful connections are facilitated. The aim is to be the go-to platform for anyone interested in bunny adoption by providing a comprehensive resource that not only simplifies the adoption process but also educates users about proper bunny care.

User Stories:
- As a potential adopter, I want easy navigation to look for specific bunny types I am interested in, so that i can adopt a bunny of my preference more easily.
- As a potential adopter, I want images and descriptions to tell me about the bunny so I can know more about it online first before deciding on whetgher to adopt it or not.
- As a first-time bunny owner, I want the website to provide information on proper bunny care, so I can be informed on how to preperly take care of a bunny.
- As a user considering bunny adoption, I want the adoption process to be straightforward and streamlined, so I can complete it efficiently and without unnecessary complications.
